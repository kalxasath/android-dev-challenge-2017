# Google Android Dev Challenge 2017

![Google Developer Challenge Scholarship badge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kalxasath/android-dev-challenge-2017/master/assets/android-dev-challenge-badge.png)

This repository contains notes as a cross-reference to the topics learned during my studies at the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship 2017 from Udacity & Google. The repositories that are used in this course are two, one for the [Exercises](https://github.com/udacity/ud851-Exercises) and the other for a weather app, the [Project Sunshine](https://github.com/udacity/ud851-Sunshine).

### What you will find in this repository
* For each lesson, I will create a summary based on the videos with a little more information enriched by me.
*  The scope is to give to the reader a fast view of what was learned in the video lessons and how to use it in his own projects, providing a basic example.
* I the end of each article I will provide some links to other interesting articles written by others.
* You can use the information as a cross-reference for your studies.

### What you will not find in this repository
* You will not find enriched content that goes beyond the level of study.
* You will not find content for advance android developers

## My Articles
> **Note:**
> Because I started to write those articles in the middle of my study, the first 8 lessons are not covert at this point in time. I will come back when I finish the whole course to complete it.
