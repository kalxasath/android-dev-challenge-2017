This repository contains notes to fast search the topics learned during my studies at the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship 2017 from Udacity & Google. The repositories that are used in this course are two, one for the [Exercises](https://github.com/udacity/ud851-Exercises) and the other for a weather app, the [Project Sunshine](https://github.com/udacity/ud851-Sunshine),.
